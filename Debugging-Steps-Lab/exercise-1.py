Exercise 1

PART 1: Gather Information
Gather information about the source of the error and paste your findings here. E.g.:
- What is the expected vs. the actual output?
- What error message (if any) is there?
- What line number is causing the error?
- What can you deduce about the cause of the error?

PART 2: State Assumptions
State your assumptions here or say them out loud to your partner ...
Make sure to be SPECIFIC about what each of your assumptions is!

Answer:
Expected - 4 
Actual - Index error - list index is out of range 
Line causing error- 6
Index is out of range so we need to add a '-1' at the end next to the length 
of the 'list_of_nums' so that it knows when the list ends.
